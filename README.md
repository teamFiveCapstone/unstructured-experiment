# An experiment using unstructured

To get started, just:

```
docker compose up
```

1. It should partition the `./files/wwf_tigers_e_1.pdf` and write the results to 
`./files/auto-partition-output.txt`. This is fast.

1. It should partition the `./files/wwf_tigers_e_1.pdf` again using the `partition_pdf` function using `hi-res` and write the results to 
`./files/pdf-partition-output.txt`. This takes a lot more time.

Then it should then create `./files/images` directory and put images from the PDF in there.

3. It performs basic chunking using `chunk_elements()` with 1000 max characters and writes results to `./files/basic-chunking-output.txt`. This breaks content into size-based chunks.

4. It performs title-based chunking using `chunk_by_title()` and writes results to `./files/title-chunking-output.txt`. This groups content semantically under document headings.
